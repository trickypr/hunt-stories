# Science labs
So, there have been random bits of tech lying around and we have heard a few sounds. Why does any of this matter? It’s not like they are stealing from us.

Well, they are. They have been taking from the science labs. They steal materials ranging from distilled water to radioactive materials. They are also ‘borrowing’ equipment, mostly returning it, sometimes in the same condition.

Whoever ‘they’ are, they are essentially ghosts. There are no signs that they entered into the room. They don’t bring in leaves in autumn or water when it's rainy. They don’t set off the motion sensors or ever get seen. They have incredible abilities and that is what makes them impressive to research.
