# SPAC Stage
SPAC has been around for six years now and it’s not in nearly the same condition as it was when it was first built. One of the most confusing changes is that to the noises of SPAC. A building with only minor changes to it in the past two years shouldn’t suddenly start making previously unheard sounds.

One week from the end of March, a few drama students talked to me about sounds that were out of the ordinary. Around the middle of the lesson, they heard a sound. One of them described it as being similar to an old mechanical hard drive spinning up. It continued for about twenty seconds then stopped.

When I went to investigate there was a low pitched, low volume pulsing sound. It was on the very edge of your hearing. Loud enough to unsettle it but soft enough not to be able to focus on it. If I can I will attach an enhanced recording of it.
