# Printers
Whoever these beings are, they are excellent hackers. Much better than anyone in the IT classes or the IT staff. A prime example of this is the network printers around the school. The IT staff discovered that someone was printing overnight.

The unusual thing about it this time was that the log files and print saves were corrupt. Ordinarily, everything on the drive becomes unusable after a corruption. With this case, only the pages that were printed at night was destroyed. 

I bet that they used the same method to simulate corruption is the same one that they use to destroy virus code before deleting it. The program loops through every bit in a file and decides with a 50% probability if it should be inverted.
