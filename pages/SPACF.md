# SPAC Foyer
We have a lot of inquisitive students ready to poke at anything out of the ordinary. Lots of teachers hate this but it has proved handy in our investigation. A Junior School student found a PCB behind one of the TVs in the SPAC foyer. 

At a glance, the device appeared to be a raspberry pi zero. This prediction fell upon closer inspection. It did have the distinctive GPIO pins and black plastic processor however it lacked the inputs of a raspberry pi. It didn’t have a visible power source like a battery or a wall adapter. It draws its power from a similar method used by RFID or the thing, a Russian spy device. When a magnetic field oscillating at 1810 kHz was applied, it activated. 

I wasn’t able to figure out the purpose of the device, but I can assume it collects some form of data, like audio. None of the components on the device are available through any electronics supplier like element 14 or LCSC.
